## Overview

UrCalls is a full-featured video conferencing platform supporting meetings, webinars, recordings, breakout rooms, whiteboards, AI meeting notes, and team/seat management.

I served as **Project Director**, responsible for coordinating end-to-end delivery across product, engineering, design, marketing, and supporting operational functions.

This repository documents **what was delivered**, **how delivery was managed**, and **the resulting product artifacts**.  
No proprietary source code is included.
